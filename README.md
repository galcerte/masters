These are the Python scripts I used to generate every graph in my master's
thesis in physics, "The Scotogenic Model of Neutrino Masses and Dark Matter in Warped Extra Dimensions".
Given that they were made and then extensively modified on short notice, they
are not in the best shape they could be. However, I will try to make them
a bit more friendly to anyone else that's not me when I find the time.

thesis.py deals with what is shown in the thesis itself, and slides.py generates
various graphs exclusive to its presentation.
